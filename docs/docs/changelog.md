## [0.23.2] - 2021-12-13

- Fixes parsing the activity_class attribute on the athlete model returned by `read_fit(metadata=True)`. It should now handle all possible values.


## [0.23.1] - 2021-11-11
### Fixed
- Some FIT files contain records with duplicate field names of which only 1 was not null. Added code to make sure that the non null value was picked.

## [0.23.0] - 2021-11-01
### Changed
- Updated dependency versions. Most notable is scikit-learn to ">= 0.23.1".

### Deprecated
- Python 3.6 support will be dropped in a next release as it is nearing EOL and some dependencies like scikit-learn already do not support it in their latest releases.

## [0.22.1] - 2021-10-19
### Fixed
- Relax Athlete model validation because it raised errors for some FIT files.

## [0.22.0] - 2021-10-19
### Added
- When `metadata=True` is passed to `sweat.read_fit()` the response now includes an "athlete" key that contains an Athlete model with information about the athlete.

### Fixed
- Suunto hrv samples that consist of only 1 value are now properly handled and do not raise a TypeError anymore.

## [0.21.0] - 2021-04-22
### Added
- Adds testing for Python 3.10
- `read_tcx()` now supports a metadata=True kwarg that will return device data.

## [0.20.3] - 2021-04-20
### Fixed
- `sweat.read_fit()` now supports integer column names.

## [0.20.2] - 2021-04-16
### Fixed
- `read_fit()` now handles summary data correctly when there is no data

## [0.20.1] - 2021-04-16
### Fixed
- Fixed issue when `pool_lengths=True` but there are no pool length records in the FIT file.

## [0.20.0] - 2021-04-15
### Added
- `read_fit() now returns pool length records when the `pool_lenghts=True` argument is passed.
- `read_fit()` now return raw FIT messages when a `raw_message=True` argument is passed.
- `read_fit()` can now return metadata and device information.

## [0.19.0] - 2021-04-06
### Added
- Adds matplotlib dependency.
- Extends `sweat.read_fit()` with support for multi session FIT files, hrv data, metadata (summaries and devices), error handling and much more...
- Properly handles left-right balance from FIT files.
- Adds Garmin FIT Profile based on the Garmin FIT SDK 21.47.

### Fixed
- Removes unnecessary numpy import in pdm docs.

## [0.18.1] - 2021-03-12
### Fixed
- Fixes the index of mean max calculations as they were of by 1 second. First index is now 00:00:01 instead of 00:00:00.

## [0.18.0] - 2021-03-12
### Added
- Adds `monotonic` argument to `sweat.mean_max()` to enforce a monotonically decreasing mean max curve. Usage: `power.sweat.mean_max(monotonic=True)`. Defaults to False.

### Fixed
- Numerical columns are now converted to numeric dtypes for gpx files.

## [0.17.0] - 2020-12-31
### Fixed
- Fixes error when loading FIT file without location data.

### Changed
